# Miami Open Data Day 2017

### What is Open Data Day?
Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data all over the world. For the fifth time in history, groups from around the world will create local events on the day where they will use open data in their communities. It is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society.

### What is our goal today?
To have an open discussion on the effects and problems of climate change and sea level rise in Miami. We want to talk to you about what we have accomplished so far, and we want your ideas on how we can do better.

### Who can participate in Open Data Day?

  We need you the most. If it wasn’t for you, this whole thing wouldn’t be happening.
  We need ideas, cheerleaders, and friends to spread the word.

**Public Servants**

  Your input and context can help us to make government data better. Come converse and learn.

## Presentation Information

- Length: 5 mins

## Wondering how to propose or discuss your project ideas?

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) works just like any other commenting system on the Internet:


- First, you'll need to [create a github account](https://github.com/join).

- Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/miami-ndoch/2016-project-proposals/issues/new). Someone from the Miami NDOCH Staff will respond with some questions or feedback.

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.*
